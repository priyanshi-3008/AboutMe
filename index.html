      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>A 20-year-old who believes that happiness comes in a fragile container with a tag 'handle with care'.<br> I like my coffee black and chocolate dark. I like cheese and metaphors a little too much.<br> Music comforts me more than a person ever could. Now, I smile more often than I laugh, and I miss it.</p>

    <p> I hold close to the music that let my soul flow, books that offer peace and a better vision, families who have at least one meal together, people who knows that they can disagree with respect.
        
        <br> On some days, I write codes and on the other days, I write poems.</p>
        
      <p> I was born in Lucknow and brought up and done my schooling in a small town named Orai. I left the town after completing my senior secondary education. I lived in Kota for a year. <br>I am doing my bachelor's from Kolkata. I am a software engineer in making.</p>
